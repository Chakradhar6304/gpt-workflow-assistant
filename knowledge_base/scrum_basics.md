Introduction to Scrum
Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. Sprints are typically two to four weeks long.

Scrum Roles
There are three primary roles in a Scrum team:

Product Owner: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.

Scrum Master: Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.

Development Team: Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Scrum Events
Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation:

Sprint Planning: This event kicks off the Sprint. The entire Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal and select items from the Product Backlog to be worked on during the Sprint.

Daily Scrum: A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

Sprint Review: Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

Sprint Retrospective: An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
